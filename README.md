JGProgressHUD Pod in RubyMotion
===================
JGProgressHUD boasts it is better than SVProgressHUD and others for the following reasons:
• Super simple to implement
• Feature rich
• Easy extensibility and customization (custom animations and progress indicators)
• Up to date, ex. using a blurred view on iOS 8
• Backwards compatibility to iOS 5
• Well documented
• Detects and repositions when Keyboards appear/disappear
• And most importantly, it looks good!

Enjoy it in RubyMotion as an alternative
